# SC Codes PHP Track

This repo will hold my up-to-date work with the SC Codes PHP Track.
The point is to be able to easily share my progress with other PHP track members and anyone following my PHP coding progress.

It will also help me get in the habit of saving my code and using Git more frequently.
